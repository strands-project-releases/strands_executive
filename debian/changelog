ros-indigo-scipoptsuite (0.0.3-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Removed readline from scipoptsuite build as we don't have an interactive interface in ROS.
  * Installing library files now with link targets as well.
  * Changes to build for both single package and repo.
    Having problems with exposing libs created by scipoptsuite which are not actually targets.
  * Now correctly fixing build dir problem.
    I was previously hardcoding the prefix in devel space which could either have been strands_executive/scipoptsuite or just scipoptsuite depending on whether this was built as standalone package or a in repo. This can be reflected in the cmake file with the scipoptsuite_BINARY_DIR variable so now I'm using that.
  * Added cmake extras to set include directories correctly for scipoptsuite.
  * Adding install targets and fixing build prefix for release.
  * Contributors: Nick Hawes

ros-indigo-scipoptsuite (0.0.1-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Adding ncurses rosdep and also correct mongodb component order.
  * Added absolute paths to libraries to ensure that dependent projects get correct linking.
  * Updated dependencies.
  * Added libgmp3-dev depenency. Fixes #23 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_executive/issues/23>.
  * libgmp-dev build_depend
  * Compilation under linux now.
  * Added md5 hash.
  * Adapting build to now apply patches on linux.
  * Working calls to the scheduler!
  * Added platform switches.
    Now to test on linux vm.

  * Linking libraries to platform independent names.
  * Compiled from scratch.
  * A working compiler with lots of cmake hacks.
  * Files installed into correct places, but not through standard ways.
    It's not clear why the cmake install commands are not being executed, but it could because the project doesn't have a proper target.
  * First commit of scipoptsuite external build
  * Contributors: Chris Burbridge, Nick Hawes
