  * Added first task logic to scheduler.
    Also made replay script work with mulitple parallel schedulers.

  * Versions of scheduling algorithm can be chosen now + logging of results to file
  * Fixed minor scheduling issues.
    1) Made service calls thread safe.

  * Reduced calls to mdp time stuff.
  * cacheing results, but seems to not be having much effect
  * Added logging of scheduling problems to datacentre.
    Inefficient use of space, but faster for CPU (duplicating db content with tasks).

  * Delayed execution tasks now working correctly with timer.
  * Publishing schedule and handling scheduler fail.
  * Set up for just patrolling. Launch file printing to screen sensible amounts.
