# Scheduler

A task scheduler implemented using mixed integer programming.

## Overview

This package provides single-robot task scheduling capabilities based on the algorithm presented in:

> L. Mudrova and N. Hawes. Task scheduling for mobile robots using interval algebra. In *2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2015)*, Seattle, Washington, USA, May 2015.

This extends prior work presented in 

> B. Coltin, M. Veloso, and R. Ventura. Dynamic user task scheduling for mobile robots. In *AAAI Workshop on Automated Action Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots*. AAAI, 2011.


## Usage

If you want your tasks to be executed, then you should use the scheduler within the [scheduled_task_executor node](https://github.com/strands-project/strands_executive/blob/hydro-release/task_executor/README.md). If you wish to use it in a standalone fashion, you can call the `get_schedule` service described below, and demonstrated in the `scheduler/tests/test_scheduler_node.py`.

## Libraries

The library `libscheduler` provides the scheduling functionality outside of ROS. Use this if you want to include the scheduler in our own C++ library without using ROS. An example of its usage is provided in the `scheduler_example` executable, compiled from  `scheduler/src/main.cpp`.

## Nodes

### `scheduler_node`

The `scheduler_node` provides task scheduling as a ROS service. Examples of using this service are available in the tests for the scheduler `scheduler/tests/test_scheduler_node.py`.

#### Services

`get_schedule` ([strands_executive_msgs/GetSchedule](https://github.com/strands-project/strands_executive/blob/hydro-release/strands_executive_msgs/srv/GetSchedule.srv)) 

Given a list of tasks (`Task[] tasks`), this service call returns the order in which they should be executed and the desired execution start time of each task. Execution order is specified by the return value `uint64[] task_order` which contains the ids of input tasks in the order they should be executed. Execution times are provided by `time[] execution_times` which is in the same order as `task_order` and states the ideal time for task execution assuming all the input durations to the scheduler are as expected. The `DurationMatrix` argument specifies the travel time between task locations. It is a 2D array (implemented as a list of lists) where `durations[i].durations[j]` specifies the travel time between the end location of task `i` and the start location of task `j`.

#### Parameters

`~save_problems` (`bool`)

If true, the scheduling problems received by the scheduler (via `get_schedule`) are stored into the [mongodb_store message store](http://wiki.ros.org/mongodb_store#Message_Persistence:_message_store_node.py) collection 'scheduling_problems'. This allows for later replay via `rosrun scheduler replay_scheduling_problems.py`. Defaults to true.

`~scheduler_version` (`int`)

Switch the version of the algorithm the scheduler is running. If not specified, the Mudrova and Hawes algorithm is used. If the value XXX specified, then the original Coltin et al algorothm is used.

`~output_file` (`string`)

Path to a desired output file. If set, output from the scheduler is saved to this file.

`~timeout` (`int`)

How many seconds to allow the scheduler to run before timing out and returning (still potentially returning a result). The default value is to not have a timeout.
